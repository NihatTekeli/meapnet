# Margin-Enhanced Average Precision Optimization and Horizontal Stripe Augmentation for Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification
## Overview
This repository contains Pytorch code for the implementation of the methods in the paper "Margin-Enhanced Average Precision Optimization and Horizontal Stripe Augmentation for Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification". The paper introduces MEAP and HSA techniques. 

### ! Important Note: The code will be made publicly available upon the publication of the paper.

## Methods
### Margin-Enhanced Average Precision
MEAP is a novel optimization strategy that enhances the average precision based loss function with a margin-based mechanism. This helps to improve the discriminative power of the model in visible-infrared person re-identification scenarios.

## Horizontal Stripe Augmentation
Horizontal Stripe Augmentation is a data augmentation technique for visible-infrared person re-identification. This technique generates augmented samples with horizontal stripes from visible and infrared modalities to improve the robustness of the model.
